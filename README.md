# Who am I?
I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer for a large, well known, online company.  As such, my day to day workload includes software development, automation, monitoring/alerting, and various other tasks.

I also have a rather varied interest in technology outside of my working life; Including, but not limited to: basic game development (godot is looking interesting at the moment).  Aside from technology, i'm also interested in various science topics, reading, films and TV, gaming, tabletop-gaming.  Standard geek life stuff :laughing:

# What is this account for?
This github account is primarily a space for me to experiment.  I'll be using it to store various small scripts, tools and interesting snippets which may help people in my own line of work or with similar interests.  Some if not all of the items found on this account will be in various states of disrepair, and may be completely abandoned at times.  This is due to my natual loss of interest and procrastination.

# Can i use your code or ideas?
If it's publically displayed on github, then it can be assumed that it's open source in nature.  Everything you use from here, is most definitely used at your own risk however.

# Can you write/help write my......?
In short, No!  I barely have time between life and family to dedicate time to my own projects, let alone be reliable enough to write software, automation or anything else in either a collaboration or for someone else.

# What's with the name?
SREiously is just a simple play on words.  I'm an SRE, and find it hard to take myself serious a lot of the time.  With that said, a lot of what you'll find on here is a serious attempt by me to either provide a solution to a problem, or at least learn something about it.

# Where are you from, who do you work for, can I have your babies?
There's a reason i picked a name like SREiously.  This account is meant to be anonymous for a reason.  I want no affiliation between this account and the company I work for, and I don't want a million invites for tech-meets in my local area either.  I will however say, that i'm happily married with a child, so, no, you can't have my babies :blush:
